# *Paulinella micropore* KR01 KEGG pathways analysis
Major results files produced from the analysis of the nucleotide biosynthesis, DNA replication, and histidine metabolism pathways in *Paulinella micropore* KR01.

## `01_Data/`

Contains the basic data (list of initial target genes) used in the study.

## `02_Scripts/`

Contains the basic python and R script used throughout the project.

## `04_Results/`

Contains the main results of the project. The `2021-01-19` subdirectory contains the results relating to the nucleotide biosynthesis and DNA replication pathways and the `2022-01-13` subdirectory contains the results relating to the histidine metabolism pathway. In each analysis directory there will be a `*.md` file that describes the purpose of the analysis, the commands that were run, and some of the results from the analysis.
