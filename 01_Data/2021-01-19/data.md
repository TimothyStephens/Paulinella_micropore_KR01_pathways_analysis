# Info about raw data

The `KR01_KEGG_Replication___From_Arwa_19Jan2021.xlsx` file lists the gene IDs of KR01 proteins that were identified as being part of the DNA Replication, Purine, and Pyrimidine KEGG pathways.
The file also lists the KEGG ortholog ID (KO number) annotated to each KR01 gene and if the gene has a crTP predicted.  

The files `DNA_Replication.txt`, `Purine.txt`, and `Pyrimidine.txt` are derived from the `*.xlsx` file and are simply the KO number and KR01 gene ID pairings. These file are used to extract and sort the genes in subsequent analysis.
